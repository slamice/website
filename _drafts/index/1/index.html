<p>On our way back from home after jamming, and my friend Takeo and I were talking about how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normcore">nerdcore fashion</a> was becoming trendy in Japan. He started to see it in some magazines, another forgien import to Japan trying to make a profit.</p>

<p>I mentioned that this sounds terribly similar to <strong>Cool Biz</strong>. I've seen signs  advertising it in the subway, on trains, billboards and in stores these past few years, especially in the summer. Isn't it trying to redefine the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaryman">salaryman</a>? trying to make going to work at a corporation cool again? It is as it sounds right?</p>

<p>[[ PICTURE EXAMPLE OF COOL BIZ ]]</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.gaijinpot.com/super-cool-biz-japan/">http://blog.gaijinpot.com/super-cool-biz-japan/</a></p>

<p>No, he said, <strong>Cool Biz</strong> is not a fashion trend. It's an agenda from the Japanese government.</p>

<p>I cannot make this up. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Biz_campaign">Coolbiz</a> started </p>

<p>oil got expensive -&gt; electrity got expensive -&gt; it's hot in japan in the summer, so air conditioner use is expensive -&gt; wear short sleeve shirts?!</p>

<p>Even today government people don't wear ties and jackets in the summer</p>

<p>Every so often I go back and read</p>

<p>When doing tech support, I tried to read everything I could about approaching problems. <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/customerservice.html">Joel Spolsky</a> is awesome as always. He reminds us you can fix problems two ways:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Superficial immediate solution, also known as a bandaid solution. Call centers and outsourced support with little communication to devs.</p></li>
<li><p>Solving longterm but going in depth into the problem, analyzing it to prevent it from happening again. As Joel says, this means you're left with only the really odd bugs, whcih is fine because they are rare and you can afford them with little added resource.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>This is incredibly great of course. However, as a dev I've helped fix those odd bugs, and it's a nightmare that usually leads down a few nasty roads. Deep bugs nestling in the edge cases of hash functions. Compilers that break when a bit flips every so often. A slave database that copies stale data only 1/10000000 of the time. Or even... Caching bugs.</p>

<p>There is a secret third way to fix problems which is infinitely unbelievable and much much harder to do. I've only encountered it a few times, but it's so amazing it brings new light to what tech support actually means.</p>

<ol>
<li>Restructure the problem, get rid of the service.</li>
</ol>

<p>Throw it away. Be it a feature or process, just try to get rid of it. If there are pain points in the system, then what if they didn't exist in the first place?</p>

<p>Of course change on this size is very difficult (not just the users, but the makers, the managers, etc.). It's almost a paradigm shift. There will be a few things you'll need to do:</p>

<p>Some people think the ultimate goal of support is so no one needs it. If no one ever writes in with a ticket, that must mean no one is confused about your product. You can throw some money at a few friendly people, a few low level developers, and get back to work.</p>

<p>This is kind of ironic though. Many companies I've seen silo people into roles, especially engineers.</p>

<p>The irony only increases with tech support, because the laundry list of system errors, different services and bug reports have gotten more complex.</p>
