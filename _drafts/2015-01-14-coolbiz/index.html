<p>On our way back from home after jamming, and my friend Takeo and I were talking about how <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normcore">nerdcore fashion</a> was becoming trendy in Japan. He started to see it in some magazines, another forgien import to Japan trying to make a profit.</p>

<p>I mentioned that this sounds terribly similar to <strong>Cool Biz</strong>. I&#39;ve seen signs  advertising it in the subway, on trains, billboards and in stores these past few years, especially in the summer. Isn&#39;t it trying to redefine the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salaryman">salaryman</a>? trying to make going to work at a corporation cool again? It is as it sounds right?</p>

<p>No, he said, <strong>Cool Biz</strong> is not a fashion trend. It&#39;s an agenda from the Japanese government.</p>

<p>I cannot make this up. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cool_Biz_campaign">Coolbiz</a> started </p>

<p>oil got expensive -&gt; electrity got expensive -&gt; it&#39;s hot in japan in the summer, so air conditioner use is expensive -&gt; wear short sleeve shirts?!</p>

<p>Even today government people don&#39;t wear ties and jackets in the summer</p>
